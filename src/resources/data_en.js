      closing: 'Looking back, my research has focused on accessibility, safety, immersion, and ease of authoring, proposing technologies that empower anyone to create virtual content and move the field forward. I validated these ideas through user studies, quantitative latency and performance tests, and stability evaluations. The experimental mindset I honed in academia remains a valuable asset in my work as a developer today.'
